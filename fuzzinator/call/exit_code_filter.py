    Decorator filter for SUT calls that return issues with 'exit_code' property.

    Mandatory parameter of the decorator:
      - 'exit_codes': if issue['exit_code'] is not in the array of exit_codes,
        the issue is filtered out.

    The issues that are not filtered out are not changed in any way.

    Example configuration snippet:
    [sut.foo]
    call=fuzzinator.call.StdinSubprocessCall
    call.decorate(0)=fuzzinator.call.ExitCodeFilter

    [sut.foo.call]
    command=/home/alice/foo/bin/foo -

    [sut.foo.call.decorate(0)]
    exit_codes=[139]
