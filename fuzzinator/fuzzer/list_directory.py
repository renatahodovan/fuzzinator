class ListDirectory(object):
    """
    A simple fuzzer to iterate through the files in a directory and return their
    contents one by one. Useful for re-testing previously discovered issues.

    Since the fuzzer starts iterating from the beginning of the directory in
    every fuzz job, there is no gain in running multiple instances of this
    fuzzer in parallel. Because of the same reason, the fuzzer should be left
    running in the same fuzz job batch until all the files of the directory are
    processed.

    Mandatory parameter of the fuzzer:
      - 'outdir': path to the directory containing the files that act as test
        inputs.

    Example configuration snippet:
    [sut.foo]
    # see fuzzinator.call.*

    [fuzz.foo-with-oldbugs]
    sut=sut.foo
    fuzzer=fuzzinator.fuzzer.ListDirectory
    instances=1
    batch=inf

    [fuzz.foo-with-oldbugs.fuzzer.init]
    outdir=/home/alice/foo-old-bugs/
    """

        self.tests = [os.path.join(outdir, test) for test in os.listdir(outdir)]
